# IIT-Mini-Project-Analyzing-Covid-Data
Python Project using NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statsmodels and Scikit learn libraries

Unlock Insights from Covid Data with This IIT Mini Project!

Dive into a comprehensive analysis of Covid-19 trends with my latest IIT Mini Project. This project is perfect for those looking to understand the power of data analytics in uncovering trends and making predictions. Using Python and powerful libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and Statsmodels, I've explored 4 key aspects of Covid-19 data:

Detailed Trend Analysis of Confirmed Cases: Understanding how cases evolved over time.
Predicting Future Active Cases: Using the ARIMA model to forecast future trends.
Examining the Relationship Between Confirmed and Recovered Cases: Uncovering hidden patterns.
Comparing Recovery Rates Across States: Analyzing which states managed the pandemic better.
With Linear Regression and ARIMA, Iâ€™ve combined predictive modeling with trend analysis to make sense of the data. This project is invaluable for data analysts, data scientists, machine learning engineers, and anyone interested in data-driven insights.
